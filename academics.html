                                    For as long as I can remember, I was always trying to figure out how things work and why they worked
                                    in a certain way. As little kid, I was the one opening my toys and rebuilding them again and again. But I
                                    think it really began when I was around 10 years old. My mom knew how important learning a second
                                    language would be in my life and put me in an English course. A couple years later I realized how
                                    much could be achieved through learning new things and what having access to study materials in its
                                    original language could provide. I was fascinated by the possibility of meeting people from all
                                    around the world and sharing knowledge throughout.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5">
                                    When I finished my course I was enthused to be an engineer, so I entered high school and joined a
                                    technician course (industrial automation) at the same time. During the course, I had contact with
                                    a lot of technologies that I later found out were German, and trying to read some of the manuals and
                                    how they worked made me wonder what Germany was like...
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5">
                                    A few researches later and my new dream is to go to Germany and speak German! I started as a
                                    self-learner using some of the technics I remembered from learning English, and almost a year later I got
                                    into a course and could improve even faster.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-5">
                                    Between all of that, I also needed to save money for my trip, as my family couldn't afford that, even
                                    though my mother always supported me. I started selling brazilian candy in my school, giving English classes,
                                    and saving money in every way I could for four years. After that, I finally had saved enough to travel,
                                    but I also ended up loving studying finance and how to control money in between. Therefore, I
                                    passed to a Federal University to study Accounting by the end of High School.

                                    The trip was planned and my dream of visiting Germany finally came true. It was so special and so
                                    rewarding for me in every single moment, as only I knew what I had to do to get there.

                                <p class="fs-5">
                                    After that I put in more effort in the Uni, got an internship in a multinational company - where I
                                    got hired later on, learned Spanish due to a six-month project working with some colleagues from Colombia
                                    and Argentina, and I'm now planning my third trip to Germany to revisit the friends I made.
