                                On my birthday, on my second trip to Germany, I met a very kind person. Her house was heart-warming,
                                 full of stuffed animals, teddy bears and little toys.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5">
                                When she found out it was my birthday, she insisted on gifting me one of them. I was politely refusing,
                                but once the phrase "You need a mascot" was spoken, something made me think about it. In the end I
                                accepted a little teddy bear and started carrying him around, as a mascot.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5">
                                A couple hours later, passing by a beautiful lake, I took a picture of him posing on a bench and at that
                                moment I got an idea to make something meaningful out of it: He will be travelling the world!
                                On that same day I started his "Around the world" album and he's been accompanying me on my adventures
                                ever since.

                            I find it really interesting that my mascot comes from a place I admire so much.
                            Of course we've both been there and I could show him some of the countryside and the mountains.

                                After having fun in the snow, it was time to meet the tropical sunshine in Brazil.
                                He's been to wonderful beaches in Rio de Janeiro, and recently had the opportunity
                                to join me on a trip to Manaus, in the Amazon rainforest.

                            I was seeing snow for the first time in my life when he joined me. And to have the full experience,
                            we - along with some friends - visited an Iglu resort in Austria. That means ice walls, ice bed,
                            ice ice and snow outside!
